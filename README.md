These are all of my coding studies separated by directories of programming languages. All of the codes has a description of the problem at the top and comments to orgnize the visualization of the logic structure. Above is a list with all directories in commom with the languages I study, so you will find them in both ways you get.

# BeeCrowd/
Also Java and Python dir have a dir called BeeCrowd, that contains secssions of programming problems solved with their solution and description on top. All of the files are named according to the number of excercise on beecrowd.com.br, so to check the veracity you have to copy the script and paste it in the excercise page opened after select the programing language said.
* In Java it's necessary to change the name of the class to Main.

# Estrutura-de-dados/
There I increase all of my data structures studies with Java or Python like stacks, queues, trees and all of that. There are just the classes with their methos without implementation and main.

# Outros/
I put in these directories just some separated codes I write to study, with no other classes or files that depends of them.
